# Hierarchical States

Some states can only happen if you're in another state. This is a hierarchy of states whre one state is the parent and the other a child.

States can have substates. ```awakeState``` can have several different substates such as ```standing```, ```walking``` or ```eating```. For hierarchical states we could add these states as children onto the parent.
